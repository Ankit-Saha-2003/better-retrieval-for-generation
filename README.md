This project aims to improve RAG performance. This is a course project for the course CS6803: Topics in NLP, taught by Dr. Maunendra Desarkar at IIT Hyderabad. This developed by Team 15, consisting of:
- [Ankit Saha](https://github.com/Ankit-Saha-2003)

## Problem Statement
Retrieving additional contents from a collection for a given context, and using these contents as expanded context can be helpful for various tasks. In this project, you will deal with the retrieval strategies that can fetch good-quality context from existing document pool, given a seed context.
